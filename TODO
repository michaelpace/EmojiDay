[√] add new renderedText -esque property to Entry which shows uncompleted sentences
[√] be able to map from index -> sentence within EntryComposer (in the case that a user taps a blank)
[√] make SentenceDirectory structure have prefix: "", validEmoji: "", instead of current setup where the key is actually a value
[√] fix EmojiKeyboard bugs
[√] get button values from SentenceDirectory
[ ] emoji entry functionality
	( ) when setting our entry:
		- generate an array indicating which sentences are in which textPieces for msptl
	( ) when user taps via msptl:
		- consult our generated array. note sentence as our "currentSentence". pull up keyboard for that prefix.
	( ) when user chooses an emoji:
		- set emoji on our currentSentence. save managedobject context. this will result in our entry getting set again, maybe.
		- actually maybe not, since we'll be editing Sentence objects, not Entry objects, unless we add, delete, or rearrange. hmm...
